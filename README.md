About Me
--------

I am a software engineer and full-stack developer. I am passionate about open-source software and have contributed to major open-source projects for over a decade. Computer programming has been an indispensable instrument of change and empowerment in my life. It has helped me build the life I wanted for myself, I hope I can help others do the same!
