Hi! My name is Eeshan Garg.
===========================

About Me
--------

I am a computer programmer and backend engineer with a decade of experience working for organizations at varying stages of maturity. Organizations I have worked for include: an open-source project, an enterprise financial technology company, and a YC-backed Series A startup.

I view computer programming as a framework for structured thought and problem solving. Furthermore, software has served as an instrument of change and empowerment in my life. One of my side quests in life is to help people discover its potential for themselves.
